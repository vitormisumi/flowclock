			question: 'What is the flowtime technique?',
			answer:
				"The Flowtime Technique is a time management method that allows you to fully immerse yourself in a task and take breaks at natural stopping points. It was created by ZoÃ« Read-Bivens as a solution to the main problem of the Pomodoro Technique, which works in strict time intervals.\n\nHere's how it works:\n1. You pick one task to focus on during a session.\n2. You work on the task for as long as you need to, stopping the clock and taking a break as soon as you start to lose concentration, feel fatigued or finish the task.\n3. Your break time is then calculated based on the length of your session, with a ratio of your choosing.\n\nThe Flowtime Technique is more flexible than the Pomodoro Technique and doesn't force you to take breaks. This allows you to work according to your natural rhythm and energy levels. It's a great method for creatives, students, professionals, and anyone else aiming to improve their concentration."
